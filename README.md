node-jwt
========

Quick and dirty JSON Web Token module for Node.js. Mainly intended for teaching myself how to create and validate JSON Web Tokens. Not really meant to ever be published on npmjs.org.

Functionality at present is limited, mainly due to wanting to be able to write as much as it from scratch as possible.
